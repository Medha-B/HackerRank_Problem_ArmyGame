# HackerRank_Problem_ArmyGame
Luke is daydreaming in Math class. He has a sheet of graph paper with n  rows and m columns, and he imagines that there is an army base in each cell for a total of  n.m bases. He wants to drop supplies at strategic points on the sheet, marking each drop point with a red dot. If a base contains at least one package inside or on top of its border fence, then it's considered to be supplied.   What is the minimum number of packages that Luke must drop to supply all of his bases? Credits to HackerRank for the problem and main().
